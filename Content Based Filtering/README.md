# Content-Based Recommender
A Content-Based Recommender works by the data that we take from the user, either explicitly (rating) or implicitly (clicking on a link). By the data we create a user profile, which is then used to suggest to the user, as the user provides more input or take more actions on the recommendation, the engine becomes more accurate.
## Step by step implementation:
+ **Data Collection:**
  + Gather data on items (e.g., products, articles, movies) including their attributes (e.g., genre, tags, descriptions).
Collect user data such as their interactions with items (e.g., likes, ratings, clicks).
+ **Data Preprocessing:**
  + Clean and preprocess the data. This might include handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical features.
  + For text data, techniques like tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words are useful. Represent text using TF-IDF.
+ **User Profile Building:**
  + Create a profile for each user based on their preferences and interactions. This can be a vector representing the user’s interests.
  + The profile can be built by averaging the feature vectors of the items the user has interacted with.
+ **Item Representation:**
  + Represent each item as a feature vector. This could include content features like tags, categories, and descriptions.
+ **Recommendation Generation:**
  + Recommend items that are most similar to the user’s profile.
  + Rank the items based on their similarity scores and present the top N items to the user.
+ **Feedback Loop:**
  + Continuously update the user profile with new interactions to improve recommendations over time.
