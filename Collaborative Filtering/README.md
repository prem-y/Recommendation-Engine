# Collaborative filtering:
A recommendation engine using collaborative filtering predicts user preferences for items based on the preferences of similar users or items. It operates on the assumption that users who agreed in the past will agree in the future. There are two main types of collaborative filtering: user-based and item-based.
## Step by step implementation:
+ **Data Preparation:**
  + Gather data containing user-item interactions (e.g., ratings, likes, or views). Represent this data as a matrix, where rows correspond to users and columns to items.
+ **Find Similar Users:**
  + Calculate similarity between users. Common metrics include Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, or Pearson correlation.
  + Identify users with similar preferences to the target user.
+ **Predict Ratings:**
  + For unrated items, predict their ratings based on similar users preferences.
  + You can use weighted averages or other techniques to estimate ratings.
+ **User-Based vs. Item-Based:**
  + User-based: Recommend items liked by similar users.
  + Item-based: Recommend items similar to those the user has already liked.
+ **Model-Based Approaches:**
  + Use dimensionality reduction techniques like matrix factorization (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition or Alternating Least Squares) to fill in missing values.
+ **Evaluate and Tune:**
  + Evaluate your model using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error
  + Tune hyperparameters to improve performance.
