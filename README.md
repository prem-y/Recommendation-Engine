# Recommendation-Engine
A recommendation engine is a system that gives customers recommendations based upon their behavior patterns and similarities to people who might have shared preferences. These systems, also known as recommenders, use statistical modeling, machine learning, and behavioral and predictive analytics algorithms to personalize the web experience.

## Types of recommendation engines
+ **Collaborative filtering:** Streaming services commonly use this filtering method. Collaborative filtering collects data on user activities and behaviors, and uses it to define preferences and predict future behavior. Recommendations are made based on the user's similarity to other people and the assumption they might like related items or actions. E-commerce sites use this type of recommender to suggest products within certain categories. It requires a lot of maintenance to update and keep accurate, making it difficult for high-volume businesses.
+ **Content-based filtering:** This analytical approach compares a person's preferences to descriptions of products or items. Item descriptions include keywords that are used to track and define user behavior. This method assumes that if a person likes an item, they are likely to want a similar one that the content-based recommender suggests.
+ **Hybrid recommendation systems:** These systems combine elements of collaborative and content-based filtering. The hybrid approach is considered the most accurate recommendation engine.
