## Hybrid Recommendation System
A hybrid recommendation system is a special type of recommendation system which can be considered as the combination of the content and collaborative filtering method. Combining collaborative and content-based filtering together may help in overcoming the shortcoming we are facing at using them separately and also can be more effective
## Step by step implementation: 
+ **Data Collection:**
  + The data which contains the userâ€™s explicit feedback. Explicit feedback can be a kind of rating from the user to the item which tells about the status of the user whether he liked the product or not.
Collect user data such as their interactions with items (e.g., likes, ratings, clicks).
+ **Data Preprocessing:**
  + Clean and preprocess the data. This might include handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical features.
+ **Fitting the Model with BPR Loss:**
  + This method can be used when the positive interaction from the user on the data is presented and we are required to optimize the ROC AUC.
  + In this using the pairwise loss we try to maximize the prediction difference between positive feedback and a randomly selected negative feedback.
+ **Evaluation of the Model:**
  + Utilising metrics of accuracy: k(precision) and ROC AUC.
  + The k will tell us whether the predictions made by the model are lying within the first k results on the list or not.
  + AUC score is a measure that tells the probability that any known positive is in a higher place on the list than the randomly selected negative
+ **Fitting the Model with WARP Loss:**
  + This is useful when the positive interaction is available in the feedback and we are required to optimize some top recommendations.
  + Here it repeatedly samples the negative feedback until it finds the one feedback which is violating the rank and this procedure maximizes the rank of positive feedback
+ **Recommendation generation and continual feedback loop:**
  + Utilizes both content-based and collaborative-filtering methods for recommendation.
  + Receives continuous feedback from user interactions and user ratings.
